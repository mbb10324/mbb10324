## Hi! I'm Miles Breman! 👋

### Senior Software Engineer 💻 | Army Veteran 🎖️ | Family First ❤️ | Driving Military Innovation 🚀

#### With nearly a decade of experience as an active-duty soldier in the U.S. Army, I dedicated my career to driving military innovation. After transitioning to the civilian world, I’ve continued that mission by working with the DOD to modernize and revolutionize its software solutions. Whether it's tackling complex problems, learning new tech, or crafting creative projects, I'm always up for a challenge! 💡

#### When I'm not at my computer, you’ll find me spending time with my amazing wife and kids 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 or building something cool in my woodshop 🪚 (sawdust is my second favorite coding language).

#### On my Github, you’ll find a variety of public repositories showcasing projects that have helped me grow as a developer and expand my understanding of modern technologies. These projects include:
- ⚛️ React libraries
- 🤖 Custom AI solutions
- 🛠️ Personal productivity applications
- 🐍 Python Flask apps
- 🌐 Fun games created in Web3
- 🎮 Video game addons written in Lua
- ...and so much more!
  
#### Each of these projects has challenged me in unique ways, helping me stay sharp and adapt to the ever-evolving world of software development. While my public repositories showcase a variety of personal projects and experiments, they are just the tip of the iceberg. A significant amount of my time and effort has gone into private and professional repositories, where I’ve tackled complex, real-world challenges and delivered impactful, high-quality solutions. I hope my work inspires others in their own journey.
