## Hi! I'm Miles Breman! 👋

### Senior Software Engineer 💻 | Army Veteran 🎖️ | Family First ❤️ | Driving Military Innovation 🚀

#### With nearly a decade of experience as an active-duty soldier in the U.S. Army, I dedicated my career to driving military innovation. After transitioning to the civilian world, I’ve continued that mission by working with the DOD to modernize and revolutionize its software solutions. Whether it's tackling complex problems, learning new tech, or crafting creative projects, I'm always up for a challenge! 💡

#### When I'm not at my computer, you’ll find me spending time with my amazing wife and kids 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 or building something cool in my woodshop 🪚 (sawdust is my second favorite coding language).

#### Want to chat or learn more about me? Curious about my work in private repositories or on GitLab? Feel free to reach out at milesbreman@gmail.com! ✉️
